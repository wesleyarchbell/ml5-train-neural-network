# 3 Steps to training a nerual network:

1. Collect the data.
2. Traing the model using the collected data.
3. Prediction; give new input and let the network guess the write answer.

# Usage guide:

1. Click on a letter on the keyboard. e.g 'a' (do not press 't')
2. Click and group the letters in a certain area on the screem which will be drawn as circles. e.g. Draw about 10 'A' circles in a group on the screen.
3. Repeat step 1&2 for a few letters.
4. Click the 't' on the keyboard to start training the model.
5. Wait for a training debug window to show and wait for it to complete training.
6. Click on the screen near each letter group and the neural network will draw the letter that it predicts your mouse click is closest too.
